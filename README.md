# phase_2_project

This project analyzes a dataset related to sleep efficiency, with a particular focus on how variables like sleep timing, exercise frequency, and deep sleep percentage impact the quality of sleep. The primary objective of this project is to identify patterns and draw statistical conclusions that can help improve understanding of the factors contributing to optimal sleep.

The analysis includes both descriptive and inferential statistics to assess key factors affecting sleep efficiency. The findings are based on a variety of visualizations and hypothesis tests, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions about the dataset.
